# 📌 Emoji Prediction Using Machine Learning  

This project is an **AI-based Emoji Prediction System** that predicts the most suitable emoji for a given sentence.  
It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with **TF-IDF vectorization** and a **Logistic Regression model** to classify sentences into emoji labels.

## 🚀 Features  
- ✅ Predicts emojis based on text input  
- ✅ Handles duplicate removal and prevents data leakage  
- ✅ Uses TF-IDF Vectorization for text representation  
- ✅ Trained with Logistic Regression classifier  
- ✅ Provides accuracy reports and confusion matrix for evaluation
